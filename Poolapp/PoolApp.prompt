I want you to build a website for Advanced Carpooling Services Offering users the ability to schedule carpooling services in advance, making it convenient for them to plan their rides with others. The website employs Eco Games to award points and Offer incentives or rewards for employees who actively participate in recycling and sustainability efforts. These could be in the form of gift cards, extra time off, or other tangible rewards. Incorporate features to helps users locate recycling bins and stations within the workplace, making it convenient for employees to dispose of recyclables. Use APIs to simulate data for electricity and water usage in workplace then generate a chart/bar graph to see the trend overtime. the website should have a login page with forget password feature (send otp email to user to reset password), and a sign up page. make sure to use javascript, nextjs components, next-auth, handlbars, app route and an sql database. now be creative and build the entire website with the features I have specified plus others to make it better then make sure to test that all the features are working using unit tests and integration tests. add appropriate styling to the website too.
